# Installation

This project works with [https://github.com/testinnplayin/t-back](https://github.com/testinnplayin/t-back)

Please be sure to install both in order to use the URL shortener.

# Resources

The front-end server is by default at port 3000.

# Use

To run the front-end server, do `npm run start` or `yarn start`. You will also need to have the back-end server running. Please see the documents for the back-end server in order to run it.

Once the front-end server is up and running, you can visit `localhost:3000` if a browser window is not opened for you.

Either enter or paste a url in the input box and then click on submit. Once submitted, a shortened url of the form `ex.co/<8 random characters>` is generated as a link. The 8 random characters form a random hex string.

You can click on the link, a new window should open and you'll be taken to the original URL.
